# Consul Template Example

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ypereirareis/consul-template-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ypereirareis/consul-template-example)

An example configuration to manage configuration files parameters, with consul and consul template.

* We use the key/value store feature of consul to create/update/delete configurations.
* We use consul-template to generate configuration files from templates and key/values items saved.

**This project is a demo, DO NOT use it directly in production.**

## Start the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ypereirareis/consul-template-example.git && cd consul-template-example
chmod +x launch.sh && ./launch.sh start
```

If you want help:

```bash
./launch.sh help
```

##Â What this script is doing

The `launch.sh` script is doing many things in this order:

* Try to clean up the stack if needed (already started before)
* Create a custom network with specific subnet ip range.
* Build a custom dind image with consul-template inside.
* Start a container running consul.
* Start a container running consul-template.
* Add two keys in consul for the demo.

The consul GUI is accessible at (by default): [http://10.123.100.78:8500](http://10.123.100.78:8500)  
Go to the key/value menu item [http://10.123.100.78:8500/ui/#/dc1/kv/](http://10.123.100.78:8500/ui/#/dc1/kv/) and update key values.

Then have a look at your configuration files (by default):

* ./config/dev.json
* ./config/prod.json

In the script you can configure your own:

* consul container name => `CONSUL_AGENT_NAME`
* consul-template container name => `CONSUL_TEMPLATE_NAME`
* custom consul-template image name => `CONSUL_TEMPLATE_IMG_NAME`
* network name for this docker project => `CONSUL_NETWORK_NAME`
* network ip address/range for this docker project => `CONSUL_NETWORK_ADDRESS`

**Of course, feel free to change anything else at your own risks.**

## Remove the stack

```bash
./launch.sh remove
```

## Tests

```bash
chmod +x tests.sh && ./tests.sh
```
